- Share statistics with collaborators
- Include in family history reports

## Understanding Pie Chart

### Gender Distribution Colors
🔵 **Blue** = Male
🌸 **Pink** = Female
⚫ **Gray** = Unknown/Not recorded

### What It Tells You
- If mostly blue: More male names/ancestors recorded
- If mostly pink: More female names/ancestors recorded
- If gray present: Some gender data missing

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When stats panel is open:
- **Click tabs** to switch views
- **Scroll** within each tab for more data
- **Click CSV** to download statistics

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is some data missing?**
A: Tree may not have complete information. Missing birth dates, death dates, or gender records show as 0 or "N/A".

**Q: What does "Unknown" gender mean?**
A: Person's gender wasn't recorded in the tree data.

**Q: Why are timelines limited to 20 events?**
A: Performance optimization for large trees. Scroll to see more.

**Q: How often are statistics updated?**
A: Automatically when tree data changes.

**Q: Can I edit statistics?**
A: No, statistics are read-only. Edit tree data directly to change calculations.

**Q: What if my tree is very large?**
A: Statistics calculate efficiently even with 1000+ nodes. Timeline shows first 20 events.

## Data Interpretation Guide

### High Average Age
→ Indicates good record-keeping and health/longevity in family

### Many Generations
→ Indicates long family history with multiple ancestral levels

### Unbalanced Gender Distribution
→ May indicate naming conventions or recording biases of the era

### Large Timeline Spikes
→ Indicates periods with multiple births (larger families)

### Missing Birth Dates
→ Common in older records or incomplete data entry
